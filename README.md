Learning, note-to-self:

Step By Step:

■ Create new Folder IN or TO Visual Studio, look at name of branch (main)
■ Create new Repository on Github with same name as Folder (also named main branch?)
■ On VSC: create file, readme, etc
■ On VSC: git init
■ On VSC: git add .
■ On VSC: git remote add main _URL of github repository from github_
■ On VSC: git push -u main main

From there on you can now just git add, commit, push and you're all set.
